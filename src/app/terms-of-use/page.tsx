            When an order is placed, we request pre-authorization for the value
            of the order from your bank/card issuer to ensure that the funds are
            available. However, this remains simply a pre-authorization request
            until the order is shipped, at which point we actually take payment.
            We have found that some card companies show the initial request and
            the later charge as two separate entries. Please be assured that we
            only charge your card once and that any 'second' charge is only
            temporary and will shortly disappear. If you have any further
            queries, please contact your bank/card issuer.
